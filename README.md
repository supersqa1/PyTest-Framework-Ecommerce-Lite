The automation flow involves:
- Selenium-based UI tests interacting with a live WooCommerce frontend
- REST API tests targeting WooCommerce endpoints
- MySQL integration to verify backend data consistency
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) automatically triggering tests and publishing reports
- Allure and HTML reporting for detailed visibility

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository (choose one based on your preferred CI/CD platform):
```bash
# For GitHub
git clone https://github.com/supersqa1/qa-bootcamp-framework.git

# For GitLab
git clone git@gitlab.com:ssqagroup1/qa-bootcamp-framework.git

cd qa-bootcamp-framework
```

> **Note**: The same codebase is maintained in both GitHub and GitLab to provide hands-on experience with different CI/CD platforms. Choose the repository that aligns with your learning goals:
> - GitHub repository for GitHub Actions
> - GitLab repository for GitLab CI
> - Either repository can be used with Jenkins CI

2. Set up virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables (see Configuration section below)

4. Run tests:
```bash
cd ssqatest
python3 -m pytest tests
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The framework uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `variables_local.sh` (Linux/Mac) or `variables_local.bat` (Windows) file with the following variables:

```bash
export BASE_URL=<your_website_url>
export BROWSER=<browser_name>  # chrome, firefox, headlesschrome,...
export RESULTS_DIR=$(pwd)/results
export DB_PORT=<your_database_port>
export DB_HOST=<your_database_host>
export DB_DATABASE=<your_database_name>
export DB_TABLE_PREFIX=<table_prefix>  # typically wp_ for WordPress
export WOO_KEY=<your_woocommerce_key>
export WOO_SECRET=<your_woocommerce_secret>
export DB_USER=<your_db_user>
export DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
```

## üîÑ Parallel Test Execution

### Overview
The framework uses pytest-xdist for parallel test execution, providing significant speed improvements for large test suites. Tests are distributed across multiple workers, with each worker running its own browser instance.

### Configuration
Parallel execution is configured in `pytest.ini` with the following settings:
```ini
addopts = -n auto --dist=loadscope
```
- `-n auto`: Automatically determines the optimal number of workers based on CPU cores
- `--dist=loadscope`: Groups tests by module/class to maintain test isolation

### Running Tests

#### Parallel Execution (Default)
```bash
# Run all tests in parallel
pytest tests/

# Run specific test directory in parallel
pytest tests/frontend/

# Run with specific number of workers
pytest -n 4 tests/
```

#### Sequential Execution
```bash
# Run tests sequentially
pytest -n 0 tests/

# Run specific test file sequentially
pytest -n 0 tests/frontend/test_login.py

# Run tests by marker
pytest -n 0 -m smoke tests/  # Run all tests marked with @pytest.mark.smoke
pytest -n 0 -m "not smoke" tests/  # Run all tests not marked with @pytest.mark.smoke
```

### Test Distribution Strategy
- Tests are grouped by module/class using `--dist=loadscope`
- This ensures related tests run on the same worker
- Each worker gets its own browser instance and profile
- Browser profiles are stored in `/tmp/` with worker-specific identifiers

### Best Practices
1. **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests are properly isolated and don't share state
2. **Resource Management**: Monitor system resources when running in parallel
3. **Debugging**: Use `-n 0` for easier debugging of specific tests
4. **CI/CD**: Parallel execution is ideal for CI/CD pipelines to reduce execution time

## üìÑ Test Structure

This project separates test code and supporting logic into two main folders:
- `ssqatest/`: Contains all tests (frontend, backend, health checks)
- `src/`: Contains reusable modules such as page objects, API utilities, data access, and custom Selenium extensions

This separation helps maintain clean architecture and enables easier reuse of logic across test suites.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conftest.py       # pytest fixtures and hooks
```

## üìä Test Execution
- Run all tests: `python3 -m pytest tests`
- Run frontend tests: `python3 -m pytest tests/frontend`
- Run backend tests: `python3 -m pytest tests/backend`
- Run specific test: `python3 -m pytest tests -m tcid33`

## üìä Test Reports
The framework supports three types of test reports, each with its own advantages:

### 1. HTML Reports (Simple and Quick)
HTML reports provide a straightforward way to view test results with basic information about test execution.

#### Generating HTML Reports
```bash
# Run tests with HTML report generation
cd ssqatest
python3 -m pytest tests --html=reports/report.html

# View the report
open reports/report.html  # On Mac
# or
start reports/report.html  # On Windows
```

HTML reports include:
- Test execution status (passed/failed)
- Test duration
- Error messages for failed tests
- Basic test information
- Screenshot of page if a test fails

### 2. JUnit XML Reports (CI/CD Integration)
JUnit XML reports are particularly useful for CI/CD integration and test result analysis in various tools.

#### Generating JUnit Reports
```bash
# Run tests with JUnit XML report generation
cd ssqatest
python3 -m pytest tests --junitxml=reports/junit.xml
```

JUnit reports are used by:
- Jenkins for test result visualization and trend analysis
- GitLab CI for test result parsing and reporting
- GitHub Actions for test result integration
- Various test result visualization tools
- Test result aggregation platforms

### 3. Allure Reports (Advanced and Beautiful)
Allure reports provide a more sophisticated and visually appealing way to analyze test results, with detailed information and analytics.

#### Generating and Viewing Allure Reports
The process involves three sequential steps:

1. First, run tests and collect Allure results:
```bash
cd ssqatest
python3 -m pytest tests --alluredir=./allure-results
```

2. Then, generate the HTML report from the collected results:
```bash
allure generate ./allure-results -o ./allure-report --clean
```

3. Finally, you can view the report in one of two ways:
   - Serve the report locally (temporary server):
   ```bash
   allure serve ./allure-results
   ```
   - Or open the generated HTML report directly:
   ```bash
   open ./allure-report/index.html  # On Mac
   # or
   start ./allure-report/index.html  # On Windows
   ```

> **Note**: The `allure serve` command creates a temporary web server to view the report, while `allure generate` creates static HTML files that can be shared or hosted.

#### Allure Report Features

</div>

Allure reports provide:
- Test execution history
- Detailed test case information
- Step-by-step test execution
- Screenshots and attachments
- Test categorization and grouping
- Historical trends and statistics

### Choosing Between Report Types
- Use **HTML reports** for quick, simple test result viewing
- Use **JUnit reports** for CI/CD integration and test result analysis
- Use **Allure reports** for detailed analysis, historical trends, and beautiful visualization

## üê≥ Docker Support
Run tests in a containerized environment:
```bash
./run_tests_in_docker.sh
```

## üìà CI/CD Integration

This framework integrates with:
- **GitLab CI** via `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- **Jenkins** using a `Jenkinsfile` located in the root directory
- **GitHub Actions** using `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

Each pipeline automatically:
- Installs dependencies
- Activates the Python virtual environment
- Loads environment variables securely
- Runs frontend and backend test suites
- Publishes reports (HTML, JUnit, Allure)
- Sends results to the Automation Dashboard (if configured)
